# trackplayer development

A network for musicians to share and listen to music, as well as collaborate on projects.  

Current Issue: Getting Soundmanager2 bar-ui player working consistently. 

Files of interest:
1. /client/lib/bar-ui.js   <- This is bar-ui player code, to setup sound manager

2. /client/views/layout.html <-- Where the html for the player is located, inside template AudioPlayer. 

Still unsure of what to place in layout.js (rendered, helpers, etc..) to make the player work consistently.
